# JEVisualizer
JEVisualizer is a program that creates a visualization video for music. The development started, when we wanted to add visualizations for our music on YouTube.

Some examples about visualizations made with JEVisualizer can be found on our YouTube channel, [John Egestas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSA9SAK2T-KkLAR59Jwy78w)

## How to build
Requirements:
```
make
g++
OpenCV 3 
```
Build project:
```
mkdir build
make all
```
## How to use
Edit config files on bin/ to make the visualizer do what you want and run bin/main.

Currently there isn't any documentation (sad story.. :'( ) I will add documentation when I have time and motivation, and when I believe that the features I'm documenting won't be changed on the very next commit.
